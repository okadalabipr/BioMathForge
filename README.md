**Integrated Biochemical Reaction Network Generation and Pathway Analysis Toolkit**

BioMathForge is a comprehensive toolkit for generating, integrating, and analyzing biochemical reaction networks. It combines AI-powered reaction network generation with advanced pathway analysis to provide insights into biological systems.

This toolkit is associated with the study: **Tsutsui M et al., 2025. *****Literature-derived, context-aware gene regulatory networks improve biological predictions and mathematical modeling*****.**

### 2. Demonstration: MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cell Line

We provide an example workflow using breast cancer-related equations curated from BioModels. These are located under `examples/mcf-7`.

#### Step 0. Prepare Input Equations

Small-scale example equations (`example_biomodels_equations.csv`) derived from BioModels are provided. Full datasets and details are described in our accompanying paper and the repository [okadalabipr/context-dependent-GRN](https://github.com/okadalabipr/context-dependent-GRN).

---

#### Step 1. Generate Formatted Reactions

Convert raw equations to a standardized format using the `generate_formatted_reactions` function.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from biomathforge import generate_formatted_reactions
import pandas as pd

biomodels_reactions = pd.read_csv("examples/mcf-7/example_biomodels_equations.csv")
validated_reactions = generate_formatted_reactions(biomodels_reactions)
```

üìÑ Output: `examples/mcf-7/generated_formula.txt`

---

#### Step 2. Analyze Pathways with Web Search

Use web-based research to identify key signaling pathways and expected readouts under experimental conditions.

```python
from biomathforge import run_pathway_analysis

report = run_pathway_analysis(
    reactions_path="examples/mcf-7/generated_formula.txt",
    condition_path="examples/mcf-7/experimental_condition.txt"
)
```

üìÑ Output: `examples/mcf-7/pathway_analysis_result.json`

---

#### Step 3. Integrate Reactions

Integrate the equations into a complete network using biological constraints and inferred readouts.

```python
from biomathforge import integrate_reactions

equations = [eq.strip() for eq in open("examples/mcf-7/generated_formula.txt") if eq.strip()]
integrated_equations, source_nodes, sink_nodes = integrate_reactions(equations, report)
```

üìÑ Outputs:

- `examples/mcf-7/integrated_equations_final.txt`
- `examples/mcf-7/terminal_nodes.json`

---

#### Step 4. Enhance Feedback and Crosstalk

Add plausible feedback loops and crosstalk reactions to improve biological realism.

```python
from biomathforge import run_enhance_feedback_crosstalk

report, enhancement_summary, added_reactions = run_enhance_feedback_crosstalk(
    reactions_path="examples/mcf-7/integrated_equations_final.txt",
    terminal_nodes_path="examples/mcf-7/terminal_nodes.json",
    reactions_overviews_path="examples/mcf-7/pathway_analysis_result.json"
)
equations = report.split("\n")
```

üìÑ Output: `examples/mcf-7/breast_cancer_reactions.txt`

---

#### Step 5. Finalize the Model

Clean up, deduplicate, and finalize the set of reactions for downstream use (e.g., simulation or export).

```python
from biomathforge import finalize_reactions

finalized_equations = finalize_reactions(equations)
```

üìÑ Output: `examples/mcf-7/breast_cancer_reactions_finalized.txt`
